	 * What are the possible design issues with this code? Realistically, not many

	 *
	 * Pretend for a moment this is a complex and useful problem to solve. In that
	 * case, we want generalized and reusable code so our solution has as much
	 * impact as possible.
	 *
	 * Is this code generalized?
	 *
	 * No. It solves for a maximum number of 1000 and for multiples of 3 or 5 only.
	 * Any changes required modification to the original source code, and then
	 * recompiling that source code. Sure, Eclipse makes recompiling seem easy but
	 * it will be beyond what most users are willing or able to do.
	 *
	 * Is this code reusable?
	 *
	 * No. You can call the main() function from other code since it is public, but
	 * you cannot get the return value or change the parameters.
