		 * necessary, which for a TreeMap can sometimes matter. (The extra put operation
		 * only happens if necessary, so sometimes there are only 1 log(n) accesses to
		 * the map, instead of 2 log(n) accesses to the map. For code that is run once
		 * on small data, it does not make a noticeable difference in runtime though.
		 * Nevertheless, I like approaches that work in more situations as my default
