	 * - InputMismatchException if non-integer input
	 *
	 * - ArithmeticException if possible is 0
	 *
	 * - Negative grades if any number is negative
	 *
	 * All of the above exceptions can get thrown even though main() does not
	 * explicitly throw any exceptions. That is because those are RuntimeException
	 * types that do not have to be explicitly caught and handled.
	 *
	 * Furthermore, the following can also go wrong:
	 *
	 * - NoSuchElementException if add before create Scanner: System.in.close();
	 *
	 * - IllegalStateException if add bug after scanner.close():
	 * System.out.println(scanner.nextLine());
	 *
	 * Generally, we want reusable methods to throw exceptions. This allows other
	 * programmers to decide how to react, making the code more generalized.
	 *
	 * However, a user-friendly main() method should not throw exceptions. That
	 * results in a stack trace, which is only useful for the developer while
	 * debugging (not the user ).
