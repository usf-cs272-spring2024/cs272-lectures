/**
 * Illustrates basic mutability using an array and primitive types. According to
 * the Java tutorials, "[a]n object is considered immutable if its state cannot
 * change after it is constructed." The term "mutable" versus "immutable" is not
 * clearly defined in the glossary or the API documentation, but is used
 * throughout the API documentation.
 *
 * The state of an object is determined by what it stores; or in simplified
 * terms, what is stored in the memory allocated for that object.
 *
 * Most data structures are mutable. However, some data structures behave
 * unexpectedly if you store within them mutable objects.
