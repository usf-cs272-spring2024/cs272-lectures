	 * PROBLEMS: Turning debugging on and off requires modification to source code,
	 * and re-compilation of that code. Would be nicer if we could control debug
	 * messages externally, via a flag or configuration file.
	 *
	 * This class is not configurable, so it is impossible to turn off debug
	 * messages for just one class. If this class is widely used, turning on debug
	 * messages could result in a lot of unnecessary output. We could try to have a
	 * per-class debug flag, but then we run into other issues.
	 *
	 * We may also want some debug messages within a class to output, but not all.
	 * For example, we may still want to see error messages. We could try to add
	 * multiple levels of debug statements, but then our class starts to get more
	 * and more complicated and computationally expensive.
	 *
	 * We may also want some debug messages to go to the console, and some to go to
	 * a file to refer to later. For example, we may want most of the debug messages
	 * to go to file, but want to know via the console when a serious error occurs.
	 * Again, we can try to achieve this in this class, but we have to worry about
	 * efficiency.
	 *
	 * Printing several messages to the console is not efficient, and will
	 * noticeably slow down your code. Printing to a file, especially in a
	 * multithreading context, can also be tricky!
	 *
	 * In some cases, more messages than the console can "remember" will be added,
	 * causing the early debug messages to be lost.
	 *
	 * In multithreading contexts, need the timestamp of when the message was
	 * generated, not when it was output. It is possible that messages get added to
	 * the console out-of-order!
	 *
	 * It just so happens there is something that addresses all of our concerns, so
	 * we don't have to re-invent the wheel!
